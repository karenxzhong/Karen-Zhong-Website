        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business Administration</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Greetings! My name is Karen Zhong and I was born and raised in Sacramento, CA. I hope that I don’t not take too much out of your day, but I would like to state that I believe that I would be a valuable member of your team. Although I am only in my first year at UCR, I am planning on majoring in business administration with the concentration of marketing. That sounds like you’re letting a rookie onto the team, but I can confidently say that I’m no rookie. 

I am very well prepared as you will see in my following resume. I’ve been proactive through my years of high school. My highschool is one of the best academically performing schools in the West Coast which is known for their college preparatory and demanding curriculum. Although difficult, I also took many college courses concurrently during high school which will result in me graduating in 3 years. I have taken many courses such as marketing, management, and although it may not sound significant, psychology and sociology. 

Something that I’m proud of that will differentiate me is that I’ve served as a waiter for 6 years. I’m only 18. Throughout these 6 years at my family restaurant I was able to build my peoples skills with effective communication, adapt to frequent changes, and work to fulfill all the needs of guests from so many different parties. Although the food service industry may not appear to be relevant in my future endeavours, but this job was truly significant in helping me realize what I wanted to pursue for my career. I enjoyed this ‘casual’ part time job for years that I finally decided I would like to learn more about this concept in a more professional environment. 

Also, throughout all my years of highschool. I was part of (ASB) Associated Student Body where I was able to hold positions such as president and dance coordinator. These two jobs required a lot of hard work. On a daily basis, I would have to work with so many people in order to achieve the same goals. It was vital for me to always be proactive, prepared, and organized. In the end, we were all able to complete our tasks on time to present countless fun and welcoming events for the public. 

Some significant achievements that I would like to mention is that I contributed to one of the biggest events in Sacramento, the Walk4Literacy campaign and raised up to $20, 000 for my class graduation. The Walk4Literacy campaign is an event that raises awareness of the low reading rates of children in the Sacramento area. By doing so, the event raises money to help fund more tutors and books to teach kids to read. The money we raised for my class was so that we would be able to graduate at the famous auditorium in Downtown Sacramento instead of walking across our school’s football field.

I feel fit to fill all of the requirements that your job requires me to do and don’t think it’ll be a loss for your company. 

With that being said, I was wondering, does your company have any current open positions that I would be able to be a part of?
